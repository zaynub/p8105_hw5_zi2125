Homework 5
================

## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Prop test for a single city:

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate ……..

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2 ideas

import one dataset

``` r
data_1 = read_csv("data/con_01.csv")

  tibble(
    path = list.files("data")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("data/", path),
    data = map(.x = path, ~read_csv(.x))) %>% 
  unnest(data)
```

Next I will tidy the unnested data:

``` r
path_tidy = 
  path_df %>% 
  separate(path, into = c("folder", "arm"), sep = 5) %>% 
  separate(arm, into = c("arm", "id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  separate(id, into = c("id", "file"), sep = 2) %>% 
  select(-folder, -file) %>% 
  mutate(
    id = str_remove(id, "0")
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "value",
    names_prefix = "week_"
  )
```

Next I will create the spaghetti plot:

``` r
data_plot = 
  path_tidy %>% 
  group_by(arm, id) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = week, y = value, group = id, color = id)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_grid(arm ~.)
```
